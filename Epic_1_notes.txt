Still needs:
- Change some naming convention ()
- More tests: password length requirement, 5 account limit, attempting to log in with invalid username, attempting to log in with valid username but incorrect password

general:

use string variables for our outputs to make pytest easier

because of the way our program works, we can only test some of the functions after creating an account, which is fine, but it does mean that pyTest needs to create an account first, log into it, and then do the testing it needs to do. That means that pyTest encountering an issue with too many users, for example, might cause a test to fail when it shouldn't. My solution to this was having pyTest copy the Users.txt file to a file object, wipe the Users.txt file, run the test, and then copy back the Users.txt file to restore it when it's done.



main function:



I cannot import the main function for pytests, so in the future I suggest we simply have a main() function and an if __name__ == "__main__" call it (which is what I did for the pytest)

Should users.txt be generated if it doesn't currently exist?

The while loop could be a while true loop with a break statement instead of needing the run variable

Casting to int means that most non-int inputs will cause an exception (floats, chars, etc.)

Choosing to create a new account and then entering an invalid username/password terminates the program (it should probably return to the 'enter userID' part of the process like logging in does)

Password requirements should be outputted by the console

Trying to create a second account doesn't seem to work; see UniqueUser

Need to close the file object when you're done using it


mainMenu:



logging out should probably return you to the start of the main menu (but this is not a part of this epic; should it be included?)

the 5 skills need to be actual skills we make up

UniqueUser:



this function doesn't work correctly. is every if not statement supposed to be nested in the for loop? it seems like only the first if statement of this function should be inside the for loop
